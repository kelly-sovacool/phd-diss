The human gut microbiome has been implicated in maintaining health.
Changes in the taxonomic composition and metabolic activity of the gut
microbiota have been associated with numerous diseases including colorectal
cancer, \textit{Clostridioides difficile} infection (CDI), irritable bowel disease,
and others,
thus the gut microbiome is a promising source of biomarkers for disease
diagnosis and prediction.
Machine learning (ML) approaches can integrate big data to gain insight into
patterns that aren't interrogable by traditional statistics
Here, we introduce a new algorithm to improve capabilities of using ML for
microbiome research,
apply ML to predict severe outcomes of CDI,
and introduce resources that empower data scientists from a range of skill
levels to take programming skills from basic through being able to apply data
science responsibly to investigate their own research questions.

Assigning amplicon sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is an
important step in characterizing microbial communities across large
datasets.
Gap in existing clustering methods: \textit{de novo} clustering produces better
quality OTUs than reference-based methods, but only reference-based methods can
be used to cluster consistent OTUs across different datasets.
However,
one may wish to incorporate new samples to previously clustered datasets
without clustering all sequences again, such as when comparing across
datasets or deploying machine learning models.
To provide an efficient method to fit sequences to existing OTUs, we
developed the OptiFit algorithm, an improved implementation
of reference-based clustering inspired by the \textit{de novo} OptiClust
algorithm.
OptiFit produces similar quality OTUs as
OptiClust at faster speeds when using the split dataset strategy.
OptiFit provides a suitable option for users requiring consistent OTU
assignments at the same quality afforded by \textit{de novo} clustering
methods.

CDI can lead to adverse outcomes including ICU admission, colectomy, and death,
with half a million cases annually in the United States.
The composition of the gut microbiome plays an important role in determining
colonization resistance and clearance upon exposure to \textit{C. difficile}.
We investigated whether machine learning (ML) models trained on OTUs from patient
stool samples on the day of CDI diagnosis could predict which CDI cases
led to severe outcomes.
We trained ML models to predict CDI severity on OTU relative abundances
according to four different severity definitions described by prior studies.
The models performed best when predicting pragmatic severity, a composite
definition based on the occurrence of complications due to any cause that uses
physician chart review to confirm the complications as CDI-attributable when
possible.
Our results suggest that while chart review is valuable to verify the cause of
complications, including as many samples as possible is indispensable for
training performant models on imbalanced datasets.
We evaluated the potential clinical value of the OTU-based models and
found similar performance compared to prior models based on Electronic Health
Records, although further work is needed to determine the feasibility of
deploying such models in clinical practice.
These OTU-based models represents a step toward the goal of deploying ML to
inform clinical decisions and ultimately improve CDI outcomes.
