NIH Training Program in Bioinformatics (T32 GM070449).

Family TODO. 
Thank you to the Ohio State fans among my extended family for not disowning me
for attending the University of Michigan.

Friends TODO. 

Kristi Janson, my high school teacher who taught the biomedical sciences
courses that made me want to become a scientist.
My undergraduate mentors at the University of Kentucky:
Jerzy Jaromczyk, Neil Moore, Dave Weisrock, and Hunter Moseley.
Hunter Moseley spent many hours critiquing my code and developed my
programming skills from crawling to running.

All those involved in The Carpentries instance at the University of Michigan who
contributed to the curriculum, taught in the pilot workshops, and continue to
empower others to learn how to code.

Past and present members of our chapter of Girls Who Code at U-M DCMB.
Especially Brooke Wolford and Zena Lapp, who co-founded the chapter;
Marlena Duda, who spearheaded the effort to develop our custom curriculum; and
Audrey Drotos and Hayley Falk, who are passing on the torch to the next
generation of graduate students to sustain this club for many years to come.
The Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, for unwaivering
support of the club, 
particularly our faculty co-sponsors Maureen Sartor and Cristina Mitrea.
Thanks to all the students who participated and tried something new.

My committee members Greg Dick, Peter Freddolino, Jenna Wiens, and Vince Young
for your helpful insights.
Krishna Rao for helping me understand clinical guidelines for diagnosing
and treating \textit{C. difficile} infections.

Members of the Schloss Lab past and present. SchLabbies TODO

Thank you to my advisor, Pat. You are the best!
