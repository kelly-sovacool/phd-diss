our curriculum is\nfree and available with an open source license so any other educators can use\nour curriculum or modify it for their own needs.\nThis curriculum is continually improved upon and is still in use for the chapter\nof Girls Who Code at the University of Michigan Department of Computational\nMedicine and Bioinformatics.\n\nIn chapter 4.3, we introduced a new curriculum to teach coding for reproducible\nresearch practices to scientists and other researchers in an academic setting.\nThe Carpentries materials that inspired us taught three topics in a disparate\nmanner: introductory R programming, the Unix shell, and version control with\ngit and GitHub. \nOur curriculum covers these topics in an integrated manner so that learners\nunderstand how they are used together in practice.\nWe piloted the curriculum in a virtual workshop and assessed our work with a \npost-workshop survey.\nOn average, learners reported that they felt more confident writing programs,\nusing programming to work with data, overcoming problems while programming, and\nsearching for answers to technical questions online.\nThis curriculum is still in use today for Carpentries workshops at the\nUniversity of Michigan and is freely available with an open source license for\nanyone to use and modify.\n\n### Software\n\nIn chapter 4.4, we introduced a tool that integrates current best practices\nfor ML in a user-friendly R package.\nOur goal was to enable researchers who are novices in ML to train and evaluate\nmodels with guard rails to prevent common pitfalls, while allowing experienced\nusers to tailor the package for advanced needs.\nAt the time of this writing, mikropml has been downloaded 13,429 \ntimes from the Comprehensive R Archive Network and 24,727 times\nfrom the Anaconda package manager, suggesting a healthy user base.\nThe reach of mikropml has expanded outside of our immediate scientific network\nand into fields spanning gut microbiome research, microbial ecology, public\nhealth, and environmental research.\nRather than write code intended for one-time-use-only to conduct the ML analyses\nshown in this work, we chose to bundle our methods into a package for others to\nreuse for their own research.\nAs a result, our efforts have contributed directly to the greater scientific\nendeavor, with 18 citations to date of the mikropml publication in the Journal\nof Open Source Software.\n<!-- mikropml snakemake workflow, schtools, mothur snakemake workflow -->\n\n## Future work\n\n### Integrate microbiota with clinical factors for improved CDI severity prediction\n\nThe ultimate goal of CDI severity prediction models is to help clinicians\nidentify early on which patients are at risk of experiencing a severe outcome\nso they can tailor treatments to prevent the outcome from ever occurring.\n\nOTUs + EHRs on same dataset.\nhuge increase in auroc may or may not translate to a huge increase in benefit\nto patients.\ndecision threshold analysis instead of just 95th percentile of risk.\n\n\nModels to guide treatment options. In the case of low-risk and non-invasive treatments\nsuch as choosing between oral antibiotics, a higher number of false positives may\nbe tolerable as long as treatment cost is not unbearably high. However, for highly\ninvasive and irreversibly treatments such as colectomy, false positives must be minimized.\n\nfidaxomicin. \nbezlotoxumab shown to prevent systemic organ damage in a mouse study [@mileto_bezlotoxumab_2022].\n\n### Beyond taxonomic composition\n\nconsider functional potential and actual function\n\nEfforts to find consistent changes in taxonomic composition of microbiomes between normal and dysbiotic states have found mixed success, in part because interpersonal variability in taxonomic composition sometimes exceeds the variability between disease states.\nVariability of microbiome composition between individuals with the same disease status may be explained by functional redundancy, where different microbial species carry out the same functions and thus can replace each other with little effect on the overall function of the community.\n\nSequencing whole metagenomes to identify the genes present and annotate known gene functions is commonly used to build a profile of functional potential of the microbiome.\nCombining taxonomic composition from OTUs with functional potential from metagenomes allows one to characterize functional redundancy across communities, where communities with similar functional potential have different taxonomic composition.\nUntargeted mass spectrometry can validate the functional potential characterized from metagenomics by identifying metabolites that are active in a community, thus painting a more precise picture of active microbial functions.\n... investigate the impacts of taking functional redundancy and active metabolites into account for microbiome analyses.\n\n\n### Democratizing the democratizers\n\ndid i seriously just write that\n\n## Conclusions\n\nTODO",
