inhabit a local environment [@konopka_what_2009].\nA microbiome consists of the microbial community in its environment together\nwith the molecules they produce such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids,\nmetabolites, and more [@berg_microbiome_2020].\nMicrobiomes are thus tightly associated with the local environment they occupy\nsuch as waterways, soil layers, ocean floors, plants, insects, and animals.\nThe human body hosts microbes that inhabit the skin, mouth, gut, vagina, airway,\nand other body regions [@human_microbiome_project_consortium_structure_2012].\nThe living members of a microbiome or referred to as the microbiota, and they\ninteract with each other cooperatively and competitively [@coyte_understanding_2019]\nand can influence the health of the host directly or indirectly [@tremaroli_functional_2012].\nThe composition of a microbiome can be characterized according to the taxonomy\nof its microbiota, the functions they carry out, and the metabolites they\nproduce.\n\nHigh throughput sequencing and other 'omics techniques can be used to\ncharacterize the metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metaproteomes, and\nmeta-metabolomes of microbiomes and describe how they change over time,\nin response to changing environments,\nor between healthy and diseased states of the host.\nA benefit of 'omics techniques is they do not require microbes to be cultured in\na laboratory, making it possible to observe genes, gene products, and\nmetabolites from microbes missed by culturing techniques and even discover new species\n[@dickson_analysis_2020].\nThese large, multivariate datasets present a challenge for bioinformatic\nanalysis, as greater computational resources and more sophisticated statistical\ntechniques are required to process and analyze big data\n[@human_microbiome_project_consortium_structure_2012].\nAn older but still widely-used method to profile the taxonomic composition of\nmicrobial communities is amplicon sequencing.\nIn amplicon sequencing, a region of a marker gene is selected depending on which\ndomain of microbial life is being targeted, and the DNA sequences matching that\nregion are amplified and sequenced [@pace_analysis_1986;@kolbert_ribosomal_1999].\nRelative to shotgun metagenomics, amplicon sequencing significantly reduces the\ncosts and computational resources needed to characterize the taxonomic\ncomposition of microbiomes.\nAmplicon sequence data can typically be identified at the genus level, while\nshotgun metagenomics data provide a finer taxonomic resolution at the species\nor strain level [@schloss_reintroducing_2019].\nWhen researchers need to extract sequences from many samples and only require\ntaxonomic resolution at the genus level, amplicon sequencing is a practical choice.\n\n### _Clostridioides difficile_ infection\n\nThe healthy gut microbiome is resistant to colonization and infection from\npathogens due to competition from beneficial microbes.\nMedications such as antibiotics, proton-pump inhibitors, and osmotic laxatives\ncan disrupt the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiome,\nthereby allowing pathogens to gain a foothold\n[@janarthanan_clostridium_2012;@tomkovich_osmotic_2021].\n_C. difficile_ is classically considered a hospital-acquired pathogen that\ninfects patients who are taking antibiotics for other illnesses, and especially\nin elderly patients as the immune system weakens with age.\nHowever, community-acquired _C. difficile_ infection (CDI) is increasing, even\nin patients with no recent history of antibiotic use [@feuerstadt_burden_2023].\nOne mechanism through which the healthy gut community protects against CDI is\nbile acid metabolism, which can inhibit the growth and alter toxin production of\n_C. difficile_\n[@theriot_antibiotic-induced_2016;@buffie_precision_2015;@sorg_inhibiting_2010].\nMouse studies have shown that the initial taxonomic composition of the gut\nmicrobiome can influence _C. difficile_ clearance, host moribundity, and cecal\ntissue damage in infected mice\n[@tomkovich_initial_2020;@lesniak_clearance_2021;@lesniak_gut_2022].\nDifferences between resilient versus susceptible microbiomes could be used as\nbiomarkers to identify patients at risk of being infected or developing severe\ncomplications.\n\nClinical outcomes of CDI can be severe, as a small portion of patients\nexperience complications requiring ICU admission due to CDI such as ileus,\ntoxic megacolon, or death in 8-9% of cases [@lucado_clostridium_2012;@kassam_clostridium_2016].\nColectomy is used as a last-resort treatment to prevent death when other\ntreatments fail, and the mortality rate in patients who undergo colectomy for\nCDI is approximately 35% [@peprah_comparison_2019].\nCDI is of particular cause for concern due to the risk of recurrence, where a\npatient experiences another CDI within 2-8 weeks of a prior CDI [@kelly_can_2012].\nIt is thought that the antibiotics prescribed to treat CDI may also prevent the\nmicrobiome from recovering, thereby perpetuating a cycle of perturbance and\n_C. difficile_ proliferation.\nAdjuvant therapies such as bezlotoxumab and fecal microbiota transplant have\nrecently been introduced to help break the cycle of recurrence by targeting the\ntoxins produced by _C. difficile_ or restoring the microbiota to a healthy\nstate, but they are not yet used widely and typically only in patients\nexperiencing a first or second recurrence [@de_la_villa_real-world_2023].\nFurthermore, vancomycin is commonly used to treat first cases of CDI, but\nvancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus_ is becoming more common and enterococci have\nbeen shown to exacerbate the pathogenesis of _C. difficile_\n[@poduval_clostridium_2000;@smith_enterococci_2022].\nThere is a great need for improved therapies to prevent recurrent and severe\nCDI, as well as for tools to predict which patients are at risk so that\nclinicians can adjust treatment plans to prevent adverse outcomes from\noccurring.\n\n## Machine learning for science and health care\n\nMachine learning techniques applied to large datasets have transformed the\nquantitative sciences towards a data-driven paradigm.\nSupervised ML approaches can be used to classify samples or make predictions,\nand researchers often claim that the good discriminative performance of a model\nsupports the veracity of an underlying scientific claim [@kapoor_leakage_2022].\nAlternatively, ML can be used pragmatically in fields like medicine in order to\naid in diagnosing diseases or to make predictions about disease outcomes,\nwith the goal of improving health care.\nModels based on clinical laboratory tests and Electronic Health Record (EHR)\ndata and have been trained to predict deterioration in COVID-19 patients\n[@kamran_early_2022], identify patients at risk of being infected with _C.\ndifficile_ in ICU wards [@otles_clostridioides_2023], and predict outcomes in\nCDI patients [@dieterle_systemic_2020].\nML models trained on microbiota have been used to improve detection of\ncolorectal cancer [@baxter_microbiota-based_2016], distinguish CDI patients from\ndiarrheal controls [@schubert_microbiome_2014], and identify which members of\nthe microbiota contribute most to the performance of these models\n[@topcuoglu_framework_2020].\n\nWhile ML techniques hold great promise to improve health care,\ncaution must be taken to train, test, validate, and deploy ML models responsibly.\nPervasive pitfalls have been identified in studies applying ML; these\ninclude data leakage between the training and test/validation set,\nfailing to set a random seed,\nbiased training data,\ninappropriate choice of performance metric,\nnot reporting variation in performance,\nand neglecting to document methods in sufficient detail\n[@kapoor_leakage_2022;@topcuoglu_framework_2020].\nErrors in ML can invalidate the conclusions of a study and erode trust in the\nscientific endeavor.\nEven worse, errors can be dangerous when ML is applied to health care, as\ndiagnoses and prognoses assisted by ML can directly affect patients\n[@beam_challenges_2020].\nBefore a model can ever be deployed in clinical practice, it must be rigorously\nevaluated to ensure it avoids these errors, and ultimately that it will improve\nrather than worsen patient outcomes [@wiens_no_2019].\nML practitioners must take care to avoid technical pitfalls and engage with\nexperts from interdisciplinary fields to ensure their models will be useful and\nbeneficial for clinical practice.\n\n## Democratizing reproducible data science\n\nData science is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science,\nstatistics, and expertise from a problem domain.\nWhen the problem domain is biology, the field could be referred to as\nbiological data science, computational biology, or bioinformatics, although\nthere is no consensus definition for any of these terms.\nAs costs decrease for generating large datasets such as those from\nhigh-throughput sequencing experiments, there is an ever-growing need for data\nscience practitioners with the skills and knowledge to process the data,\nmake inferences, and communicate their findings.\nDemocratizing data science means making the theory, methods, and tools, more\naccessible by creating educational resources, user-friendly software tools, or\neven simply making data publicly available.\nAccessibility is important for filling the growing demand for skilled data\nscientists across sectors as well as to improve diversity in the field\n[@ncses_diversity_2023;@gilshan_ethics_2021;@cowgill_biased_2020;@hong_groups_2004].\nNon-profit organizations have been founded to help address the diversity gap in\ncomputer science, data science, and other STEM fields including\nGirls Who Code,\nWomen in Science and Engineering,\nAssociation for Women in Science,\nSociety for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science,\nand many others.\n\nAn important attribute of any scientific finding is reproducibility, where\nothers can repeat the same methods on the original dataset to obtain the same\nresult [@schloss_identifying_2018].\nReproducibility does not guarantee correctness, replicability, nor\ngeneralizability, but it is a minimal achievable standard that helps others\nevaluate scientific claims [@sandve_ten_2013].\nA finding could be entirely unreproducible, where the data are not\nshared and the analysis methods are not described in sufficient detail.\nAchieving perfect reproduciblity is unlikely as eventually link rot, software\nbugs, and shuttering of organizations can occur, but \"good enough\" practices are\nattainable [@wilson_good_2017].\nAside from enabling others to validate or build upon one's work, reproducible\npractices make researchers more productive both collaboratively and individually\n[@wilson_good_2017].\nAs a reproducibility crisis has been identified in virtually all scientific\nfields including microbiology, bioinformatics, and ML for health research,\npromoting and encouraging reproducible practices is important to re-establish\ntrust and trustworthiness in scientific findings\n[@gelman_statistical_2016;@schloss_identifying_2018;@kapoor_leakage_2022;@mcdermott_reproducibility_2021].\nHowever, many early-career researchers lack the quantitative and computational\nskills and self-confidence necessary to perform reproducible computational\nscience, in some cases due to prior demotivating experiences\n[@cuddington_challenges_2023].\nToward the goal of disseminating reproducible research practices,\nSoftware Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry (together under the\numbrella term \"The Carpentries\") have developed extensive educational\nmaterials and taught them in hands-on workshops worldwide to researchers,\nscientists, librarians, and other data wranglers [@wilson_software_2016].\nA particularly important contribution of The Carpentries is the instructor\ntraining course which promotes evidence-based pedagogical practices that\nmotivate and empower learners, such as instruction via participatory live-coding\n[@deans_science_2015;@carpentries_training_2021].\nImproving access to educational resources for best practices in coding and\ndata science will equip budding scientists with the skills necessary to\nconduct and communicate their work reproducibly.\n\n<!--\nml common pitfalls.\nis democratizing data science dangerous?\n-->\n\n## Dissertation outline\n\nIn the preambles of chapters two through four, I note my specific contributions\nto the work described in each chapter.\nChapter 2 presents OptiFit, a new OTU clustering algorithm that enables\nresearchers to fit new data to existing \\textit{de novo} OTUs while maintaining\nOTU quality.\nChapter 3 presents findings from training ML models to predict the severity of\nCDI from OTUs and comparing model performance to prior approaches.\nChapter 4 introduces two curricula and one software package which help\ndemocratize data science for a range of audiences.\nIn Chapter 5, I discuss the impacts of the findings presented in Chapters 2\nthrough 4 and propose future work to build upon this dissertation.\n\n## Datasets used in this dissertation\n\nIn Chapter 2, we re-used previously published 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence\ndata extracted from four different communities: soil, marine, mouse gut, and\nhuman gut.\nUsing multiple datasets from disparate sources allowed us to\ndemonstrate the suitability of OptiFit for microbiome researchers and microbial\necologists with diverse scientific interests.\nIn Chapter 3, we used a dataset of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences extracted\nfrom 1,277 stool samples collected on the day of diagnosis from\nCDI patients at the University of Michigan.\nWhite blood cell counts and creatinine levels were also collected on the day of\ndiagnosis in order to calculate IDSA severity scores.\nThe occurrence of ICU admission, colectomy, or death within 30 days was recorded\nand in some cases, physicians conducted chart review to determine whether the\ncomplication was attributable to the CDI.\nIn Chapter 4, we used results from surveys of learners who participated in the\nGirls Who Code club and Carpentries workshop where we piloted our new\ncurricula, which allowed us to measure the success of our teaching approaches.\nThe data are described in further detail in each of their respective chapters.\n\n",
