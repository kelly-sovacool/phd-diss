protists, and viruses -- that inhabit a local environment.\nThe microbiome consists of the microbial community together with the molecules\nthey produce such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, metabolites, and more [@berg_microbiome_2020].\nhuman microbiome...\n\nmicrobial ecology / microbiome definitions.\nthe role of the microbiome in human health\ndefine microbial community

science,\nstatistics, and expertise from a problem domain.\nWhen the problem domain is biology, the field could be referred to as\nbiological data science, computational biology, or bioinformatics, although\nthere is no consensus definition for any of these terms.\nAs costs decrease for generating large datasets such as those from\nhigh-throughput DNA sequencing, there is an ever-growing need for data science\npractitioners with the skills and knowledge to process the data, make\ninferences, and communicate their findings.\nDemocratizing data science means making the theory, methods, and tools, more\naccessible by creating educational resources, user-friendly software tools, or\neven simply making data publicly available.\nAccessibility is important for filling the growing demand for skilled data \nscientists across sectors as well as to improve diversity in the field\n[@ncses_diversity_2023;@gilshan_ethics_2021;@cowgill_biased_2021;@hong_groups_2004].\nNon-profit organizations have been founded to help address the diversity gap in\ncomputer science, data science, and other STEM fields including\nGirls Who Code, \nWomen in Science and Engineering, \nAssociation for Women in Science,\nSociety for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science,\nand many others.\n\nAn important attribute of any scientific finding is reproducibility, where\nothers can repeat the same methods on the original dataset to obtain the same\nresult [@schloss_identifying_2018].\nReproducibility does not guarantee correctness, replicability, nor\ngeneralizability, but it is a minimal achievable standard that helps others\nevaluate scientific claims [@sandve_ten_2013].\nA finding could be entirely unreproducible, where the data are not\nshared and the analysis methods are not described in sufficient detail.\nAchieving perfect reproduciblity is unlikely as eventually link rot, software\nbugs, and shuttering of organizations can occur, but \"good enough\" practices are\nattainable [@wilson_good_2017].\nAside from enable others to validate or build upon one's work, reproducible\npractices make researchers more productive both collaboratively and individually\n[@wilson_good_2017].\nHowever, many early-career researchers lack the quantitative and computational\nskills and self-confidence necessary to perform reproducible computational\nscience, in some cases due to prior demotivating experiences\n[@cuddington_challenges_2023].\nToward the goal of disseminating reproducible research practices,\nSoftware Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry (together under the\numbrella term \"The Carpentries\") have developed extensive educational\nmaterials and taught them in hands-on workshops worldwide to researchers,\nscientists, librarians, and other data wranglers [@wilson_software_2016].\nA particularly important contribution of The Carpentries is the instructor\ntraining course which promotes evidence-based pedagogical practices that\nmotivate and empower learners such as instruction via participatory live-coding\n[@deans_science_2015;@carpentries_training_2021].\n\n<!--\nbuild quantitative self-confidence in biologists [@cuddington_challenges_2023].\nnot only teach people how to code, but teach them how to follow best practices.\n\nml common pitfalls.\nis democratizing data science dangerous?\n-->\n\n## Datasets used in this dissertation\n\nIn chapter two, we re-used previously published 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence\ndata extracted from four different communities: soil, marine, mouse gut, and\nhuman gut.\nUsing multiple datasets from disparate sources allowed us to\ndemonstrate the suitability of OptiFit for microbiome researchers and microbial\necologists with diverse scientific interests.\nIn chapter three, we used a dataset of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences extracted\nfrom 1,277 stool samples collected on the day of diagnosis from\nCDI patients at the University of Michigan.\nWhite blood cell counts and creatinine levels were also collected on the day of\ndiagnosis in order to calculate IDSA severity scores.\nThe occurrence of ICU admission, colectomy, or death within 30 days was recorded\nand in some cases, physicians conducted chart review to determine whether the\ncomplication was attributable to the CDI.\nIn chapter four, we used results from surveys of learners who participated in the\nGirls Who Code club and Carpentries workshop where we piloted our new\ncurricula, which allowed us to measure the success of our teaching approaches.\nThe data are described in further detail in each of their respective chapters.\n\n## Dissertation outline\n\nIn the preambles of chapters two through four, I note my specific contributions\nto the work described in each chapter.\nIn chapter two, we present a new OTU clustering algorithm that enables\nresearchers to fit new data to existing \\textit{de novo} OTUs while maintaining\nOTU quality.\nIn chapter three, we train ML models to predict the severity of CDIs from OTUs\nand compare model performance to prior approaches.\nIn chapter four, we introduce two curricula and one software package which help\ndemocratize data science for a range of audiences.\nIn chapter five, I discuss the impacts of the findings presented in chapters two\nthrough four and discuss future work to build upon this dissertation.\n\n",
