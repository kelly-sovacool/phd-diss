# Introduction

## Microbial communities in human health / microbial ecology / microbiome

the role of the microbiome in human health

define microbial community [@konopka_what_2009], microbiome, microbiota [@berg_microbiome_2020]

how to characterize them. meta- genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and emerging
new technologies.

amplicon sequencing older yet still in wide use. cost effective. down to genus
level.

## Machine learning for science and health care

ml-based science to learn about underlying biology, and practical application to
improve health care.
pragmatic approach -- use microbiome profile as biomarkers for health, or 
mechanistic approach -- understand underlying mechanisms.

Models deployed in health care settings to predict deterioration in COVID-19 patients [@kamran_early_2022],
identify patients at risk of being infected with _C. difficile_ in intensive care units [@otles_clostridiales_2023], and

Do no harm [@wiens_no_2019]

## _Clostridioides difficile_ infection

## Democratizing reproducible data science

build quantitative self-confidence in biologists [@cuddington_challenges_2023]

not only teach people how to code, but teach them how to follow best practices

reproducibility & replicability [@schloss_identifying_2018]
