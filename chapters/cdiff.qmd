## Preamble

This chapter aims to predict CDI severity from the taxonomic composition of the gut
microbiome.
We trained models on OTU relative abundances to predict four different severity
definitions,
identified features of the microbiota that may prevent or promote severity,
and assessed the potential clinical value of micriobiome-based
prediction models.

I performed all of the analysis and created the figures and tables for this chapter.
Other co-authors conceived of the study, processed samples, and assisted in
training ML models.
This chapter will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal with the following
co-authors:
Kelly L. Sovacool, Sarah E. Tomkovich, Megan L. Coden, Jenna Wiens,
Vincent B. Young, Krishna Rao, and Patrick D. Schloss.
