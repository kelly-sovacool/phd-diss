## Preamble

This chapter aims to predict CDI severity from the taxonomic composition of the gut
microbiome.
We trained models on OTU relative abundances to predict four different severity
definitions,
identified features of the microbiota that may prevent or promote severity,
and assessed the potential clinical value of micriobiome-based
prediction models.

I performed all of the analysis and created the figures and tables for this chapter.
Other co-authors conceived of the study, processed samples, and assisted in
training ML models.
This chapter will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal with the following
co-authors:
Kelly L. Sovacool, Sarah E. Tomkovich, Megan L. Coden, Jenna Wiens,
Vincent B. Young, Krishna Rao, and Patrick D. Schloss.

we do not know which antibiotics were prescribed to treat these CDI cases, nor
which antibiotics patients may have taken prior to the CDI.
differences in microbiota between patients may be due to different abx...
different antibiotics have been shown to create different forms of dysbiotic
microbiota [@berkell_microbiota-based_2021] and
differential cdi clearance [@tomkovich_initial_2020].


Models to guide treatment options. In the case of low-risk and non-invasive treatments
such as choosing between oral antibiotics, a higher number of false positives may
be tolerable as long as treatment cost is not unbearably high. However, for highly
invasive and irreversibly treatments such as colectomy, false positives must be minimized.
