# Discussion

## Major contributions

### Novel method for reference-based OTU clustering

Enables improved OTU quality paired with machine learning 

### Microbiome models for CDI severity

### Educational resources

### Software

In chapter 4.4, we introduced a tool that integrates current best practices
for ML in a user-friendly R package.
Our goal was to enable researchers who are novices in ML to train and evaluate
models according to best practices, while allowing experienced users to tailor
the package for advanced needs.
At the time of this writing, mikropml has been downloaded `r cran_downloads` 
times from the Comprehensive R Archive Network and `r conda_downloads` times
from the Anaconda package manager.
The mikropml publication has been cited 18 times in fields spanning gut
microbiome research, microbial ecology, public health, and environmental
research.
