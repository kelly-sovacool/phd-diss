### Novel method for reference-based OTU clustering

Enables improved OTU quality paired with machine learning.
Prior to OptiFit, the only option for researchers who wanted to deploy OTU-based
ML models was to cluster both the training set and external validation sets to
the same database using a closed-reference clustering method.
Reference-based clustering against a database produces lower quality
OTUs than _de novo_ clustering, but _de novo_ clustering results in slightly
different OTU assignments when adding new sequences.
Now with OptiFit, an initial dataset can be clustered _de novo_ and then used to
train a model, then new sequences from an external validation set can be fit to
the OTUs from the training data prior to deploying the model on the new dataset.
A follow-up paper demonstrated the suitability of OptiFit for this very task [@armour_machine_2023].

### Microbiome models for CDI severity

### Educational resources

### Software

In chapter 4.4, we introduced a tool that integrates current best practices
for ML in a user-friendly R package.
Our goal was to enable researchers who are novices in ML to train and evaluate
models according to best practices, while allowing experienced users to tailor
the package for advanced needs.
At the time of this writing, mikropml has been downloaded `r cran_downloads` 
times from the Comprehensive R Archive Network and `r conda_downloads` times
from the Anaconda package manager.
The mikropml publication has been cited 18 times in fields spanning gut
microbiome research, microbial ecology, public health, and environmental
research.
